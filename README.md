## Security measures

* All private information stored are encrypted by AES-256 using key and initial vector generated by the user's e-mail address & identification code. If no users are logged in to Chrome, a default key and iv will be used to encrypt and decrypt data instead. 
  * This means:
    * If the user status is changed (e.g. you logged out or switched an account), the data stored inside the storage will be no longer usable.
    * If you leaked **both your e-mail and identification code**, then the data is possible to be decrypted by anyone who has the source code of this extension.
    * For more details, see https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/identity/#method-getProfileUserInfo
* No HTTP request is created directly by this extension during its lifetime.
  * This means no information is sent manually to any servers (including my private ones).
* You can output and input information in **plain text** in options page. Please store them in some location safe and trusted.

By using this extension you agree with **The developer of this extension is not responsible for any privacy leaks**.
